# Payload list
This list consists of different types of payload to test from. Since there are different kinds of SQLi, not all may work. But we have a big list in our hands to use!
<br>
The above list is taken from `https://github.com/payloadbox/sql-injection-payload-list`, thanks to them!
For more information, read their README.

## Application
The most common SQLi is `auth_bypass` ones, and for easy CTF's, auth_bypass is enough. But to run all of them, you need Barpsuite.
<br>The files have been made text files seperately for each of them, since it is easier to use this as it is.
