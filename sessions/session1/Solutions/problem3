What the sender did was write the message in a grid with 10 columns and 16 rows, and just rotate it 90 degrees, so that the ciphertext was in a 16x10 grid. To get the plaintext, rotate it back.

The solution is-
 THIS IS A TRANSPOSITION CIPHER. ITS JUST A GRID ROTATED 90 DEGREES. HOWEVER THERE CAN BE MORE COMPLEX TRANSPOSITIONS LIKE EXCHANGING COLUMNS. {MATRICES_ARE_COOL}%
