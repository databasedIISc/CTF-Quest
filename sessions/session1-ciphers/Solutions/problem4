Here, too, the method of guessing words (Ioypvrxw can be Vigenere) will come in handy, although to a lesser extent. Kasiski's Examination, in which you find repeating fragments of ciphertext, can help you find the length of the key. With a length of, say, n, you know that every nth letter is shifted by the same offset, so you can use frequency analysis these letters to get more information.

The key is `SLING` and the final answer is- 
The Vigenere cipher had a (somewhat undeserved) reputation of being unbreakable for a long time. Kasiski broke the Vigenere cipher in 1863. However, you don't need to know Kasiski's method to crack this one, even though knowing it will be very helpful. This is just a filler sentence to help you people with the frequency analysis. {WELL_DONE_STRANGER}
